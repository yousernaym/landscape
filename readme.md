A real-time terrain engine I worked on between 2001 and 2006. Written in C++/HLSL with shader model 2.0. The code is a bit beginner's style at times but I like how the visuals turned out.

## Installation
Run [landscape-win32.exe](https://github.com/yousernaym/landscape/releases/)
## Building the source
The easiest way to get all build and runtime dependencies is to download [Dependencies.zip](https://github.com/yousernaym/landscape/releases/) and extract the contents to the repo directory. Then run *Dependencies\Runtime\DirectX\dxsetup.exe*
